[![Open to Opportunities](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20to%20Opportunities-yes-blue.svg)]()

Iâ€™m a Senior DevOps Engineer (CKA) with strong hands-on AWS experience and a growing focus on Generative AI. My day-to-day work centers on cloud-native platforms, automation, reliability, and production-grade architectures. Iâ€™m intentionally expanding into GenAI to become a Cloud Solutions Architect who can design secure, scalable, cost-aware AI-enabled systems and perform confidently in interviews.

## What you'll find in this profile / repo
This profile is organized to demonstrate learning, experiments, and project artifacts that support my journey to Cloud Solutions Architect with GenAI capability:

- learning/ â€” concise notes, summaries, checklists (Kubernetes, AWS, GenAI)
- projects/
  - eks-production-setup/ â€” Terraform + EKS + GitOps + observability
  - ecs-serverless-patterns/ â€” ECS + Fargate examples, CI/CD
  - genai-integration/ â€” prototypes: embedding pipelines, RAG, LLM API integrations
  - lambda-ml-workflows/ â€” serverless inference patterns, S3-backed datasets
- interview-prep/ â€” system design case studies, mock Q&A, flashcards
- docs/ â€” architecture diagrams, runbooks, postmortems

Each project aims to show architecture diagrams, IaC, CI/CD, verification steps, cost considerations, and learning outcomes.

## Combined learning roadmap â€” 6 to 18 months (Cloud + GenAI)
Short-term (0â€“3 months)
- Strengthen AWS fundamentals (VPC, IAM, networking, core services)
- Deepen Terraform patterns and remote state management
- Build a reproducible EKS cluster with GitOps (ArgoCD) + observability
- Intro GenAI: call multiple model APIs from small services (Lambda/container), practice prompt engineering

Medium-term (3â€“9 months)
- Design and implement a multi-account AWS landing zone (Terraform + Org SCPs)
- Implement secure model access, secrets management, and data privacy (KMS, VPC endpoints)
- Build embedding pipelines: precompute embeddings for documents in S3, store vectors in a vector DB (FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone)
- Implement RAG prototypes with provenance and basic hallucination checks

Long-term (9â€“18 months)
- Architect scalable inference: autoscaling on EKS/ECS, batching, GPU vs CPU decisions, spot usage for cost control
- Master cost optimization, reliability, and performance tuning at scale
- Produce architecture case studies (data platform, SaaS multi-tenant, event-driven apps with GenAI components)
- Prepare for AWS Solutions Architect (associate â†’ professional) and system design interviews

Advanced (12+ months)
- Fine-tuning and parameter-efficient tuning for domain tasks
- Hybrid architectures: on-prem/edge + cloud + hybrid vector stores
- Continuous improvement pipelines for model quality (feedback loops, metrics)

---

## GenAI practical roadmap (hands-on phases)
Phase 1 â€” Foundations (0â€“2 months)
- Learn tokens, decoding strategies, model families, inference vs fine-tuning
- Prompt engineering fundamentals and evaluation
- Small experiments: call OpenAI/Anthropic/open-source APIs from Lambda and container services

Phase 2 â€” Retrieval & Data (2â€“6 months)
- Ingest documents into S3, build ETL to produce embeddings, store vectors in a vector DB
- Implement RAG: retrieval â†’ prompt assembly â†’ LLM query
- Track provenance, add hallucination and quality checks

Phase 3 â€” Production patterns (6â€“12 months)
- Scale inference (EKS/ECS autoscaling, batching, GPU node pools)
- Secure pipelines (IAM roles, KMS, private endpoints)
- Observability for ML (latency, throughput, token usage, cost, quality metrics)

Phase 4 â€” Advanced ops (12+ months)
- Fine-tuning pipelines and evaluation
- Cost-aware inference strategies, hybrid deployments, benchmarking

## Project ideas to showcase GenAI + Cloud skills
- RAG-powered runbook assistant: S3 document store, embedding pipeline, vector DB, Lambda API, EKS frontend
- Automated ingestion: ETL from sources â†’ embeddings â†’ vector store â†’ query service
- Cost-aware inference platform: real-time vs batch inference, autoscaling examples on ECS/EKS, spot usage
- Local LLM demo: open-source model on GPU-backed EKS nodes with scalable endpoints
- Security & compliance playbook for GenAI services (encryption, access controls, audit trails)

Each project should include:
- architecture diagram
- IaC + CI/CD deployment steps
- verification & tests
- runbook, cost analysis, and learning outcomes

---

## Interview prep plan
- System design: 1â€“2 case studies/week (architecture diagrams, trade-offs, reliability, cost)
- Kubernetes & AWS labs: practical exercises â€” troubleshooting, manifests, RBAC, networking
- GenAI exercises: design RAG systems, discuss latency/accuracy trade-offs, prompt evaluation
- Behavioral: STAR stories focusing on incidents, automation, and leadership
- Coding & scripting: Python automation, moderate algorithmic problems (LeetCode), and DevOps scripting tasks

Recommended resources
- AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Kubernetes docs & CKA hands-on tasks
- System Design Primer (donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- Research and blog posts on RAG and prompt engineering
- Hands-on lab providers (A Cloud Guru, Coursera)

---

## How I track progress
- Use issues/projects to track learning tasks and interview topics
- Keep weekly learning logs in learning/
